I worked on a project focused on automating the classification of Plasmodium parasites for malaria detection using machine learning techniques. The workflow involved identifying the optimal image size (56Ã—56) using 2D Fourier Transform and sampling functions, followed by extracting critical image features using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Laplacian of Gaussian, Canny Edge Detector, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). To refine the feature set, we applied non-parametric statistical tests for optimal feature selection. Finally, multiple machine learning models were trained to efficiently classify malaria-infected cells. This project aimed to enhance the accuracy and automation of malaria diagnosis, reducing reliance on manual microscopic inspection and improving diagnostic efficiency.
