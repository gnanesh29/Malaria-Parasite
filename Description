One of the most dangerous diseases in the world is malaria. This is brought on by a female Anopheles mosquito bite, which spreads Plasmodium parasites. Manual microscopic inspection and RDT are two modern malaria detection methods. These methods are susceptible to errors made by people. Worldwide death rates from malaria can be decreased with early detection. Deep Learning may prove to be a very useful tool for disease diagnosis. This model offers a quicker and less expensive way to find plasmodium parasites. 
The primary function of the custom convolutional neural network is to discriminate between blood samples that are healthy and those that are infected. Based on ResNet Architecture, the model The average image size in the Kaggle dataset is 256*256 pixels. However, the size of the image cannot always be 256 * 256 pixels. It may not be 256*256 pixels. In order to detect the malaria parasite, we have developed a method that uses 28*28 pixels and can tell if the image is less than 256*256 pixels.
 After the model has been trained, many blood sample images are fed into it to check the planned system's correctness. The accuracy of the model we built for 256*256 pixels was 94.62%, but the correctness of the model we built for the 28*28 picture pixels was 94.92%. Even though the image was smaller, its accuracy remained the same.
